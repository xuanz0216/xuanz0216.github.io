A data lake is a storage repository that can store large amount of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It offers high data quality to increase analytics performance and native integration.

Unlike a hierarchal data warehouse where data is stored in files and folder. Data lake has a flat architecture. Every data element in a data lake is given a unique identifier and tagged with a set of metadata information.
